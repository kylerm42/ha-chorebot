# Plan Feedback

I've reviewed this plan and have 1 piece of feedback:

## 1. Feedback on: " // Timed tasks: Compare full datetime
      return now <= dueDate;"
> I think we'll be ok if tasks with time are treated as all day tasks for this situation. As long as they're completed on the same day, the streak should continue.
